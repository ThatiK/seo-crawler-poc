## 1. Objective

To transition the SEO Metadata & Content Crawler from architectural design to a functional Proof of Concept (PoC) with a focus on engineering execution, planning, responsibility distribution, evaluation, and quality delivery.

---

## 2. Engineering Breakdown (Workstreams)

| Module | Description | Key Tasks |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Input Loader | Load URLs from MySQL/GCS to Kafka | Cloud SQL schema, file scanner, Kafka publisher |
| Kafka Infra | GKE-based Kafka with Helm and observability | Helm setup, HPA, topic creation, monitoring |
| Crawling Engine | FastAPI with Kafka Consumer | Batch and async crawl, retries, politeness |
| robots.txt Enforcement | Respect domain crawling rules | Robots parser integration, domain-level rate limits |
| Output Batching | Write metadata and HTML to GCS | In-memory buffering, flushing thresholds |
| BQ Loader | Load metadata from GCS to BigQuery | Schema alignment, partitioned loading |
| DLQ and Metrics | Failed crawl handling and observability | DLQ topic, BigQuery table, Prometheus counters |
| Orchestration & Deployment | CI/CD and infrastructure rollout | GitHub Actions, Terraform, Helm manifests |
| Evaluation Dashboard | Metrics visualization | Grafana or Looker Studio on top of BigQuery |
| Documentation | Internal and external usage guidance | Config options, data schema, API references |

---

## 3. Blockers and Risk Assessment

| Category | Blocker | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| GCP Quotas | GKE/GCS/BQ rate limits | Medium | Pre-request quota increases, batching |
| robots.txt Rules | Sites disallow bots | High | Detect and skip, log policies |
| Cost | BigQuery storage and compute | Medium | Use partitions, avoid SELECT * |
| Latency | HTML fetch delays | High | Timeout, retry, DLQ |
| Parallelism | Skew in input file sizes | Medium | Partition by domain or time |
| Deployment | Helm chart or GKE issues | Medium | Validate in staging cluster |
| Infra Stability | Kafka crashes or lag | Medium | Autoscaling, monitoring alerts |

---

## 4. Implementation Timeline

| Week | Milestone | Workstreams |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Week 1 | Foundation setup | GCP infra, Kafka, Cloud SQL schema |
| Week 2 | Core crawling engine | FastAPI, metadata extraction |
| Week 3 | URL ingestion | GCS/MySQL to Kafka |
| Week 4 | Kafka Consumer + robots.txt | Async consumer, retry and DLQ |
| Week 5 | Output and loading | GCS batch flush, BQ load |
| Week 6 | Observability setup | Prometheus, dashboards |
| Week 7 | Testing and QA | Latency, retries, cost controls |
| Week 8 | Final PoC and documentation | Demo run, final output, documentation |

Total estimated time: 8 weeks

---

## 5. PoC Evaluation Criteria

| Dimension | Metric | Measurement |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Reliability | Success rate | crawl_success_total / total |
| Performance | Latency metrics | Prometheus histograms |
| Scale | URLs and domains per hour | Kafka and BQ counts |
| Cost | Per 1M URLs | GCP billing export |
| Coverage | Domain and URL breadth | Input file coverage |
| Compliance | Robots.txt adherence | Skipped URLs |
| Observability | Metric visibility | Dashboards |
| Failure Handling | DLQ rate | crawl_dlq_total / total |
| Extensibility | Signal addition speed | Field extraction time |

---

## 6. Plan to Evaluate the PoC

- Run full pipeline on 3 test domains: `amazon.com`, `walmart.com`, `target.com`
- Each domain with 10K URLs
- Collect and review: latency, retry, DLQ, robots.txt compliance, cost
- Compare to baseline benchmarks and SLOs

---

## 7. Team Roles & Ownership

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Infra Engineer | Kafka setup, Helm, Terraform |
| Backend Engineer | FastAPI development, retry logic |
| Data Engineer | GCS to BQ loader, schema validation |
| SRE | Prometheus, scaling, alerting |
| Tech Lead / PM | Timeline, prioritization, testing |
| QA / Analyst | Output correctness, quality checks |

---

## 8. Release Plan

| Phase | Activities |
|-------|-----------|
| Internal Alpha | Small domain test, logs, DLQ |
| Internal Beta | Scaled run with monitoring |
| Client Pilot | Expose metadata for one domain |
| Final PoC | Full demo, documentation, reports |

---

## 9. Resources & Tools

| Category | Tools |
|---------|-------|
| Cloud | GCP (GKE, GCS, BQ, Cloud SQL) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions, Terraform |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana |
| Containers | Docker, Artifact Registry |
| API Layer | FastAPI, requests, aiohttp |
| Parsing | BeautifulSoup, NLTK, robots.txt parser |

---

## 10. Documentation Deliverables
